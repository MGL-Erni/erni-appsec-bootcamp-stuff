### OWASP ZAP Active Scanning for APIs
Introduction

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security testing tool that helps identify vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs. This guide explains the internals of OWASP ZAP’s Active Scan feature in great technical depth, assuming you've already populated ZAP’s “Sites Tree” with one or more API endpoints from requests/responses.
Sites Tree and Contextual Awareness
Sites Tree Representation

    Hierarchical Representation: The Sites Tree in ZAP is a hierarchical representation of every domain, path, and parameter that ZAP has encountered.
    Nodes: Each node corresponds to either a URL (e.g., https://api.example.com/v1/users) or a sub-URL/endpoint.
    API Entries: For APIs, these entries might include descriptive nodes for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests, etc., as well as the query parameters or JSON body parameters.

Contexts and Scope

    Contexts: Before running an active scan, you can define “contexts.” A context groups a set of URLs or endpoints that share characteristics (e.g., same application, same session handling).
    Scope: Active scanning is generally restricted to endpoints “in scope” to prevent inadvertently scanning endpoints or domains you do not own or do not wish to test.

Baseline from Passive Reconnaissance

    Passive Exploration: While passively exploring the application (proxying your traffic or spidering), ZAP collects information such as cookies, HTTP headers, session tokens, forms, and potential injection points.
    Sites Tree Population: This information populates the Sites Tree and annotates potential vulnerabilities.
    Aggregator: The aggregator of all known requests, parameters, and potential injection vectors is critical for the active scanner to know what to test.

Core Active Scanning Engine
Purpose

The Active Scan mechanism attempts to attack the target application deliberately—injecting payloads, tampering with parameters, and looking for anomalies or distinctive responses that indicate vulnerabilities.
Spidering vs. Active Scanning

    Spider or Crawler: Discovers endpoints (or API routes) either through HTML links or JSON-based references. For modern APIs, you might also use ZAP’s AJAX Spider or import an OpenAPI/Swagger definition.
    Active Scan: Takes the discovered set of endpoints and systematically sends crafted requests to detect flaws.

Insertion Points

    Identification: ZAP identifies “insertion points.” These are places in requests that can be manipulated: URL parameters, query parameters, JSON fields, cookies, HTTP headers, path segments, and sometimes message bodies (XML, JSON, form data).
    Payload Injection: For each insertion point, the active scanner systematically attempts a range of payloads designed to trigger common vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability Checks and Techniques
Injection Attacks

    SQL Injection (SQLi): ZAP sends various SQL dialect payloads (e.g., ' OR '1'='1) into parameters. If the response or server behavior changes (500 errors, database error messages), it flags a potential SQL injection.
    Command Injection: The scanner injects shell-metacharacters (e.g., |, &, ||) into parameters to see if the server is executing them.
    XML External Entity (XXE) Injection: If the endpoint processes XML payloads, ZAP can craft payloads that reference external entities to detect unsafe XML parsers.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

    Reflected XSS: The scanner injects JavaScript payloads (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>) into query, path, or JSON parameters, then checks if the response body or DOM includes that script unneutralized.
    Stored XSS: Harder for an automated scanner to confirm, but ZAP tries repeated requests to see if malicious data is persisted and subsequently returned in later responses.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

    Token Presence: Checks for the presence or absence of anti-CSRF tokens or other standard CSRF protection mechanisms. ZAP might highlight endpoints that are missing tokens.

Directory Traversal and Path Manipulation

    Path Sequences: Tests sequences like ../ or %2e%2e/ in paths or parameters to see if the server responds with files outside the intended directory or reveals error messages indicating an attempt at file access.

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

    Special Hostnames: ZAP attempts to detect SSRF by trying special hostnames or internal IP address references in parameters. If it sees unusual behavior or error messages, it flags potential SSRF.

Other Checks

    Unrestricted File Upload
    Vulnerable or Disallowed HTTP Methods (PUT, DELETE)
    Weak TLS Ciphers or Insecure SSL Configurations
    Information Disclosure or Error Leak Checks

Process Flow of an Active Scan
Scan Initialization

    Target Definition: User defines which site(s) or endpoints to target.
    Scan Policies: Selects scan policies: specific scanner plugins, thresholds (e.g., only high-risk checks), and levels (e.g., whether to run intrusive checks).

Target Enumeration

    Endpoint Listing: ZAP lists all endpoints from the Sites Tree that are in scope.
    Template Request: For each node (endpoint), it retrieves a template request that includes parameters, session tokens, and other relevant headers.

Attack Execution (Per Endpoint)

    Component Breakdown: ZAP breaks down each request into all workable components (insertion points).
    Payload Injection: For every insertion point, it cycles through relevant payload sets. For instance, if it’s scanning for SQL injection, it tries a series of known SQL injection strings.
    Observation: The tool sends each crafted request to the server and observes:
        HTTP response codes (200, 401, 500, etc.)
        Response content (error messages, reflected data)
        Response times (some vulnerabilities are timing-based)
    Suspicious Results: If suspicious or anomalous results are encountered, the scanner logs a potential vulnerability.

Correlation and Confirmation

    Strong Signals: If a certain check gets a strong signal (e.g., a SQL error message in the response), the plugin logs a correlated potential vulnerability with supporting evidence.
    Active Confirmation: Some checks attempt “active confirmation.” For example, a timing-based SQL injection plugin might run the same query multiple times with different conditions to confirm a consistent delay.

Reporting

    Dynamic Alerts: As the active scan progresses, findings are dynamically added to ZAP’s “Alerts” tab.
    Alert Details: Each alert includes a confidence level, a severity rating, and sometimes raw request/response data that backs up the alert.

Internal Architecture and Extensibility
Plugin Model

    Modular Approach: ZAP’s scanning is plugin-driven. Each vulnerability check is a separate module that can be maintained, added, or removed without affecting the entire scanning framework.
    New Vulnerabilities: This modular approach makes it easier to keep up with new vulnerabilities and testing techniques.

Scan Policy

    Scan Policy Definition: A “Scan Policy” in ZAP dictates which plugins run, the strength of scan (number of payloads), and how aggressively it modifies requests.
    Strength Levels: For example, you can enable “High” strength for SQL injection tests, which means more payload variations, possibly increasing scan time.

Session Handling

    Token Management: Many web apps and APIs use tokens (JWTs, cookies, OAuth) to maintain state. ZAP has session handling scripts that attempt to maintain an authenticated session so the scan can test endpoints behind login flows.
    Token Replay: The active scanner automatically replays or re-requests valid tokens if configured, ensuring that scanning can continue even when tokens expire.

Targeted vs. Automated

    Targeted Scanning: While ZAP can run a fully automated scan across all endpoints, advanced users often do “targeted scanning” to fine-tune which parameters, endpoints, or vulnerabilities to probe. This approach avoids noise from scanning every endpoint with every plugin in an unfiltered manner.

Handling API Endpoints Specifically
Request Structures

    JSON Payloads: RESTful APIs often use JSON payloads. ZAP parses these bodies into potential parameters (e.g., "userId", "role", etc.) for injection points.
    Form-URL Encoded: Some APIs still use form-urlencoded parameters or custom data formats—ZAP will parse as many known/standard content types as possible.

HTTP Methods

    Method Types: Because APIs frequently use PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc., the scanner might produce different results for each method type.
    Consistency: ZAP tries to reuse the method from the original captured request to keep the testing consistent with real application usage.

Handling Large/Complex APIs

    Endpoint Limitation: If your API is very large, scanning every endpoint with every possible payload can be time-consuming. ZAP offers controls to limit or scope the endpoints for the active scan, focusing on high-priority routes.
    OpenAPI/Swagger Import: You can use OpenAPI/Swagger import to feed endpoints directly into the Sites Tree, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

Key Considerations and Best Practices
Avoid Production Environments

    Testing Environment: Active scanning can cause errors, large logs, or even DoS conditions if the server is fragile. It’s best used on staging/pre-production environments.

Validate Findings

    Manual Verification: Automated tools can report false positives. Always verify vulnerabilities manually. ZAP typically includes raw request/response pairs to help confirm issues.

Custom Scripts

    Advanced Use Cases: ZAP supports scripting (e.g., with JavaScript, Python, Groovy) for advanced use cases. This allows you to craft specialized checks or rewrite requests beyond the normal scanning logic.

Performance Tuning

    Configuration Controls: Large sets of endpoints and high-intensity payload sets can prolong a scan. ZAP’s “Threads per host,” “Delay in ms,” and “Max results to list” are configurable to control performance and load.

Conclusion

OWASP ZAP’s Active Scan is a systematic, plugin-based, and intentionally intrusive test of your application or API endpoints. By leveraging the prior knowledge from the Sites Tree (containing all discovered endpoints, parameters, and session tokens), the scanner injects targeted payloads to uncover potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, or path traversal. Its internal architecture is modular and extensible, meaning new attack vectors can be added via plugins, and its scanning policies can be fine-tuned for different environments.

This combination of structured vulnerability checks, flexible session handling, and integration with a rich endpoint discovery process makes ZAP’s Active Scan a powerful tool for identifying security weaknesses before an attacker does.
